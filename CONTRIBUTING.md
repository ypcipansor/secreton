# Contributing to Secreton

Thanks for helping. Secreton is a secrets-management platform and pre-1.0 — the API and
storage shapes can still change, so a contribution that simplifies something is as welcome
as one that adds something.

> **Start with [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md).** It is the single source of truth for the layout,
> the commands, and the invariants review enforces. This file covers the human workflow
> around it; where the two disagree, `AGENTS.md` wins.

## Before you start

Read the invariants in `AGENTS.md`. They are not style preferences — each one is there
because violating it caused a real defect here. The three that surprise people most:

- **Axum only, one listener.** The UI, the REST API and gRPC answer on one port from one
  router. If you find yourself adding a second `serve()` call, stop.
- **No build-time network access.** A build script that downloads an artifact breaks
  hermetic, offline and air-gapped builds. This is why `utoipa-swagger-ui` is not a
  dependency and `protoc` is vendored.
- **Audit before returning.** Any handler that reads, writes or deletes a secret emits an
  `AuditEvent` — including on the denial path, which is the path that matters.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Rust — rustup installs the pinned toolchain from `rust-toolchain.toml` (1.94.1) on first
  use. Do not pass `+nightly` to any command.
- [`cargo-leptos`](https://github.com/leptos-rs/cargo-leptos):
  `cargo install cargo-leptos --locked --version 0.3.7`. The pin is required on this
  toolchain — 0.3.8 and later resolve `wasm_split_cli_support` 0.2.3, which does not
  compile on 1.94.1 (E0658). See the Dockerfile.
- PostgreSQL and MySQL — only if you are working on the dynamic database-credentials
  engine. Everything else runs against in-memory storage with no external service.
- Node and `playwright-core` — only for regenerating screenshots. The version is pinned in
  the root `package.json`; see [Screenshots](#screenshots).

### Get it running

```bash
git clone https://github.com/analisaperlengkapan/secreton.git
cd secreton

export SECRETON__AUTH__JWT__SECRET="$(openssl rand -base64 48)"
cargo leptos serve
```

Then open <http://localhost:3000>. A fresh instance is sealed and has no accounts; the
quick-start in the [README](README.md#quick-start) initialises it, unseals it, and creates
a user you can sign in with. Storage defaults to in-memory, so there is nothing to set up
and nothing to clean up — but state is gone on restart.

## Layout

Ten crates, strictly layered: a crate may only depend on those above it.

| Crate | What it holds | May not contain |
|---|---|---|
| `crates/domain` | Shared types, the one `SecretonError`, the API envelope | Any I/O, any web framework — it must keep compiling for `wasm32-unknown-unknown` |
| `crates/crypto` | AEAD, KDF, signing, Shamir, the transit engine, the barrier | Storage, HTTP |
| `crates/storage` | One `StorageBackend` trait; memory, file, PostgreSQL, Redis, Raft | Business logic |
| `crates/auth` | Auth methods, identity, MFA, tokens, policy engine, governance | HTTP, axum layers |
| `crates/engines` | Secret engines, seal, audit, lifecycle, the `Services` graph | HTTP — no `axum`, no `Request`, no `StatusCode` |
| `crates/ui` | Leptos components, routes, server functions | Server-only dependencies |
| `crates/server` | Axum router, handlers, middleware, gRPC, the binary | Business logic — delegate to `engines` |
| `crates/client` | Typed HTTP client over `/api/v1` | — |
| `crates/cli`, `crates/agent` | Binaries built on `client` | Direct storage access |

The reason for the layer boundary is concrete: it is what lets the same service back a REST
handler, a gRPC method and a Leptos server function without a translation layer, and what
lets the UI share its request and response types with the backend so a mismatch is a
compile error rather than a runtime surprise.

## Checks

Run these before pushing. CI runs exactly this set, plus a feature matrix, an MSRV job, a
docs job and a Docker build.

```bash
cargo fmt --all
cargo clippy --workspace --locked --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test   --workspace --locked

# The UI must keep compiling for wasm. This is the guardrail that catches a
# server-only dependency leaking into crates/ui.
cargo check -p secreton-ui --locked --target wasm32-unknown-unknown \
    --no-default-features --features hydrate
```

Both feature combinations of the server must also build:

```bash
cargo check -p secreton-server --locked --no-default-features
cargo check -p secreton-server --locked --features grpc
```

`docker build -t secreton:local .` is worth running when you touch the frontend build. The
image is the only thing that exercises cargo-leptos end to end — the Tailwind run,
wasm-bindgen, wasm-opt and the feature set cargo-leptos builds with. Six separate defects
lived in that path while every cargo command passed.

## Testing

Unit tests live beside the code in `#[cfg(test)]`; integration tests go in that crate's
`tests/`. There is no root `tests/` directory — the root manifest is a virtual workspace,
so cargo never builds one, and roughly thirty files sat there for months being silently
ignored.

Two rules worth stating explicitly:

- **Name a test after the property, not the function.** `rolled_back_transaction_writes_are_discarded`,
  not `test_transaction`. The name is what tells the next person what regressed.
- **Never depend on the network.** If you need an endpoint that cannot be reached, use
  `192.0.2.1` (RFC 5737).

Cryptographic code gets property tests in `crates/crypto/tests/properties.rs`. The dynamic
database-credentials engine gets integration tests that connect to a live server and assert
the account exists after issuing and is gone after revoking — a generated username and
password returned without provisioning anything is not an implementation, and a caller
cannot tell the difference from a response body.

## Adding things

### A REST endpoint

Handler in `crates/server/src/handlers/`, exposed from that module's `routes()`. Business
logic goes in `crates/engines`, never in the handler. Add the `utoipa` annotation so it
appears in the OpenAPI document. Public (pre-auth) routes go in `public_routes()`;
everything else sits behind the auth layer by default.

Return errors through the shared envelope; do not leak internals. A 5xx body carries a
fixed string, with the detail going to the log correlated by `x-request-id` — connection
strings and file paths must never reach a response body.

### A UI page

Components in `crates/ui/src/components/`, pages in `crates/ui/src/pages/`, routed in
`app.rs`. Fetch data with a `#[server]` function, not a hand-written `fetch` — the server
function shares its types with the backend, so a mismatch is a compile error. Any page you
add must be reachable from `app.rs`; an unrouted page is dead code.

### A storage backend

Implement `StorageBackend` in `crates/storage/src/backends/`, behind a cargo feature, with
integration tests. A backend without tests does not go in — nineteen were deleted for
exactly this reason: they compiled, were selectable from config, and returned
`"Not implemented"` in production.

### A dependency

Add it to `[workspace.dependencies]` in the root manifest and reference it as
`foo.workspace = true`. Never pin a version in a member crate: that is how this repository
ended up with two versions of `axum` and `reqwest` in one tree.

## Screenshots

UI changes should show their result. The capture script signs in through the real form —
the session is in an `HttpOnly` cookie, so driving the form is the only way in — and fails
if any view is blank, errored, overflowing, or logging an unexpected console error.

Its one dependency is declared and pinned in the root [`package.json`](package.json), so a
capture is reproducible rather than dependent on whatever `NODE_PATH` happens to hold.
None of this is part of the Rust build.

```bash
npm ci                                      # installs the pinned playwright-core
npm run browser:install                     # once, fetches the matching Chromium
npm run screenshots:check                   # optional: prove the browser launches
cargo leptos serve                          # in one terminal
npm run screenshots                         # in another
```

`npm run browser:install` is a separate step on purpose: `npm install` should not reach the
network for a browser, and neither should anything in the Rust build. If you already have a
Chromium, skip it and set `CHROMIUM_PATH=/path/to/chromium`.

It writes `docs/screenshots/*.png`, which the README embeds. A screenshot that shows a
blank page or a raw error is worse than none, which is why the script asserts rather than
just capturing.

## Commits and pull requests

Conventional-commit titles (`feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, …) with a capitalised subject.

Before opening a PR:

- [ ] `cargo fmt --all`
- [ ] `cargo clippy --workspace --locked --all-targets -- -D warnings`
- [ ] `cargo test --workspace --locked`
- [ ] The wasm check above
- [ ] You ran the app and exercised the change
- [ ] No new build-time network access
- [ ] No secret, token or key material in a log line, `Debug` impl or error message
- [ ] Secret-touching paths emit an audit event, including on denial

State in the description what you verified and what you did not. An unticked box is
information, not a failure — claiming verification you did not perform is the actual
problem.

## Reporting bugs and security issues

Open a GitHub issue for bugs; include what you expected, what happened, and the smallest
reproduction you have.

For a vulnerability, **do not open a public issue** — follow [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) and
report it privately. That file also documents the project's design commitments and its
known limitations, which is the honest place to look before concluding that something is a
bug.

## Community

Be decent to each other; the standards are in [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
Report unacceptable behaviour to the maintainer address in `Cargo.toml`.
