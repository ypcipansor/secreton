//! # Secreton Domain
//!
//! The shared vocabulary of the workspace: the unified error type, the API envelope, and the
//! value types every other crate agrees on.
//!
//! This crate is deliberately **pure** — no I/O, no database drivers, no web framework. That is
//! what lets it be depended on by the Axum server *and* by the Leptos UI compiled to
//! `wasm32-unknown-unknown`. Anything that needs a socket, a file handle, or a `tokio` runtime
//! belongs in a crate above this one.
