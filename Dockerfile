# Build
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# One image builds both halves: the native server binary and the WebAssembly
# bundle, via cargo-leptos. There is no second frontend image and no nginx —
# the server serves its own frontend, which is the point of the SSR move.
#
# protoc is vendored and there is no utoipa-swagger-ui downloading a zip
# mid-build, so the application's own build touches nothing but the crates
# registry. Two things in this stage still do: `cargo install cargo-leptos`
# compiles openssl-sys from source (openssl-src is in its tree), and
# cargo-leptos fetches the Tailwind CLI on first use because this project sets
# `tailwind-input-file`. Both happen while building the image, not while
# building the application — but calling the image "air-gapped" would be wrong.
#
# Debian's `binaryen` package is deliberately NOT installed. It supplies
# wasm-opt, which would save a download — but bookworm ships version 108, and
# that rejects the sign-extension instructions (`i32.extend8_s`) current rustc
# emits by default. Putting it on PATH makes cargo-leptos use it and the build
# fails at "error validating input", which is worse than the download.
#
# perl and make are what openssl-src needs. The slim image ships perl-base,
# which lacks FindBin, so OpenSSL's ./Configure aborts on line 15 and
# `cargo install cargo-leptos` fails outright — this image could not be built
# without them.

# `cargo leptos build` accepts only `--release` — it has no `--locked`, so an
# earlier version of this line failed outright. The lockfile is still what gets

# the version cannot drift from what the WASM was compiled against.
